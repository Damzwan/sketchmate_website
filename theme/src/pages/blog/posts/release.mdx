## The Exciting Part 😎

After long and boring development and thorough testing, I'm pleased to announce that SketchMate is now available to the public!

- [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ninja.sketchmate.app)
- [Web app](https://app.sketchmate.ninja/) (for non-android users)

Throughout the development process, it became clear that creating a robust sketching app is harder than I imagined 💀.
However, with determination, SketchMate has been brought to life.

I also crafted a logo to encapsulate SketchMate's playful, sharing essence. After much deliberation, here's what we settled on:

<img src="/assets/images/logo1.png" alt="First Contender"
     style="display:block; margin:auto; padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:20px" width='400'/>

Choosing wasn't easy; here are the two other contenders:

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between', paddingTop: "20px", paddingBottom: '40px'}}>
    <img src="/assets/images/logo2.png" alt="First Contender" style="display:block; margin:auto;" width='300'/>
    <img src="/assets/images/logo3.png" alt="First Contender" style="display:block; margin:auto;" width='300'/>
</div>


And, don't miss our launch video that showcases what SketchMate offers:


<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', paddingBottom: '40px'}}>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T3Y_EneDAPY?si=iWLq6_SC1ZpNcFfO"
            title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
            allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


## A Heads Up 🙈

SketchMate isn't perfect yet. As a solo developer, I've kept the scope limited. There might be undiscovered
bugs and room for improvement in user experience. If you like SketchMate, please share your feedback.
Connect with me via email, Discord, Instagram, or LinkedIn - links at the page bottom.

## Goodbye for now ✈️

I've dreamt of traveling for a year, and that dream is coming true. However, during this time, I won't be
updating SketchMate. I hope to return and refine the app if there's continued interest. Until then, may
SketchMate spark your creativity!

See you next year!
